# Golf Scorecard (No-Install Version)

## How to run
1. Download this folder.
2. Double-click **index.html** to open it in your web browser.
3. That's it. Start a round, add players, and track scores.

> Your scores auto-save in your browser. Use the **Undo** button for mistakes and **Reset** to start over.
> The **Keep screen awake** toggle may work only in some browsers.

## Notes
- This single-file version uses React, Tailwind, and Babel via CDNs.
- Internet connection is required the first time so the CDN scripts load.
- No backend. All data stays in your browser.
